          <h2 class="research-subtitle"> 01/25/2025 </h2>
          <p class="research-body"> Today, we did cold plunges at the gym. It was really cool to spend some time with the bros and also great for the body. I had never done an ice bath before, and it was the weirdest experience. We did 3-minute sessions each. After the first 20 seconds, I lost all feeling of cold and instead felt a really hot sensation throughout my entire body, along with a burning pain all over my skin. I think that’s the mental challenge of the ice bath—you don’t endure the cold; you endure the pain on your skin. </p>
          <h2 class="research-subtitle"> 01/23/2025 </h2>
          <p class="research-body"> Yesterday, I trained at night and then again this morning. Feeling great, I've been applying the concept of "play" in training. If you go 100% every time, you're going to burn out. It's better to play around, try new things, and make it fun.</p>
          <h2 class="research-subtitle"> 01/06/2025 </h2>
          <p class="research-body"> I've been away from blogging for some time. I've been uploading all my training sessions in this new app called BJJ Buddy. I will try to upload everything to this website. 
          <br>I am actually thinking about creating a mini dashboard on this page for stats such as submissions, taps, and the number of rounds. I need to figure out how to do it, haha. 
          <br>Nonetheless, I've been focusing on gym strength and training whenever I can. I feel motivated and super strong! I've already started to enjoy every part of training, which is amazing because I want to train all the time now.
          <br>I've been practicing a lot of judo takedowns. I am starting to get the theory, but I need to find a training partner or some way to practice the throws every day. </p>
          <h2 class="research-subtitle"> 01/06/2025 </h2>
          <p class="research-body"> First class of the year felt amazing. This year, the goal is to roll until my belt turns purple. Right now, I am a blue belt with three stripes. Let's goooooooo! </p>
          <hr />
          <h2 class="research-subtitle"> 04/30/2024 </h2>
          <p class="research-body"> Today we had a couple of graduations. I was so happy thinking that I would get my third stripe on my blue belt. Nonetheless, there was no recognition for me. I don't take it personally; I haven't been consistent enough to definitely earn it, but I do feel that I've put in the work. Anyways, I will use this "disappointment" to train even harder to get that stripe. </p>
          <h2 class="research-subtitle"> 04/23/2024 </h2>
          <p class="research-body"> Taking today as a rest day. I will do some abs and stretching but no training today. Life has gotten in the way. Balancing work, university, and personal life while living alone with my girlfriend sometimes takes a heavy chunk of effort. Nonetheless, it is definitely worth it for growth and happiness. </p>
          <h2 class="research-subtitle"> 04/22/2024 </h2>
          <p class="research-body"> Monday, and we start the week with good energy. Had a very cardio-intensive training session today. Almost nailed a helicopter choke on a friend. Nonetheless, I missed the arm trap to finish it. I will work on it. </p>
          <h2 class="research-subtitle"> 04/20/2024 </h2>
          <p class="research-body"> Yesterday, I went out with my friends and had some beers and shots. Obviously, I will not train today since I am not a teenager anymore. I feel bad because with just one day of missing training, I feel like I am letting myself and my goals down. Either way, on Monday, I will grind again! </p>
          <h2 class="research-subtitle"> 04/19/2024 </h2>
          <p class="research-body"> Creating this new journal. It will be my personal blog. I know nobody is going to see it. Nonetheless, it will definitely help me mentally and also track my progress.</p>
