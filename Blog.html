        <p class="entry-content">
          Have been away some time from blogging. I have been uploading all my trainings in this new App called BJJ Buddy. I will try to upload it all to this website. I am actually thinking about creating a mini dashboard on this page for the stats such as submissions and taps and number of rounds. Have been focusing on gym strength and training whenever I can. I feel motivated and super strong! Have already started to enjoy every part of the training which is amazing because I want to train all the time now. Have been practicing a lot of judo takedowns, I am starting to get the theory, I need to find a training partner or some way to practice the throws every day.

        <p class="entry-content">
          Today we had a couple of graduations. I was so happy thinking that I would get my third stripe on my blue belt, nonetheless there was no recognition for me. I don't take it personal, I haven't been so constant as to definitely get it, but I do feel that I have put the work in. Anyways, will use this "disappointment" to train even harder to get that stripe.
